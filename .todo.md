# monk

## Todo
* Get rid of the scripts/snakemake, and just have python functions for more complex behaviors
    * Common analysis methods will be store in `monk.methods`
    * Move analysis runners totally into the `workflows` directory, using `signac-flow`
* Write a first pass at the forward flux code
    * Maybe do this for a brownian particle in a simple well first (without HOOMD) âœ…
    * Then move to try this with a glassy particle
    * Compare FF and isoconfiguration estimates for free energy barrier
* Oscillatory shear simulations
    * Make some simple methods for driving and controlling the system
        * Continually updated sinusoidal shear (for thermal systems)
            * Implement plugin for the sinusoidal Variant object
        * Triangle-wave shear for athermal systems
    * `signac` managed workflows for these types of sims

* Mud stuff
    * Plots of shear rate vs stress for simple LJ system (athermal)
