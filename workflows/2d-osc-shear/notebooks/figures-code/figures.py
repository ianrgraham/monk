Thought: maybe split paper up into two pieces
    1. inter-cycle rearrangements
    2. stroboscopic rearrangements

Figure -1:
(A) Schematic of softness calculation
(B) Schematic of VAE NN model

Figure 0:
details:

(A) Schematic of experimental protocol
(B) Heat map of D2min/T1 events/propensity for HTL system below yield, in
transiet regime
(C) Heat map of D2min/T1 events/propensity for GQ system below yield, showing
reversibility
(D) D2min irr plot
(E) D2min irr plot

Figure 1:
(A) MSD vs. time, for a handful of different shear rates (2%, 5%, 8%)
(A inset) A but log scaled
(B) Local particle propensities for the HTL system 5% shear
(C) Local particle propensities for the GQ system 5% shear
(D) Van Hove function for the HTL system, 5% shear, log spaced time points
(D inset) Van Hove function for the GQ system, 5% shear, log spaced time points
(E) Scatter plot of propensity and structural predictor (softness, excess
entropy)

Figure 2:
(A) Inter-cycle rearrangement rates inter-cycle for HTL and GQ systems, below and
above yield
(B) Inter-cycle rearrangement rates using NN instead of softness
